# MatrixConfig
# The optimized config for Matrix Anticheat,
# a powerful anticheat for Minecraft.
# For Matrix 5.1.0+
#
# This config may not work perfectly with your server.
# Plugins, software, performance can all effect how well this config and the anticheat in general will work.
# This is not a drag-and-drop solution! Some values may need to be changed to work best with your setup.
#
# Matrix Anticheat isn't a perfect anticheat. It itself has bugs that we cannot fix.
# This config aims to mitigate those issues and improve what works well, but there's only so much we can do.
#
# Tested and configurated for survival and minigame
# servers. Tweak the config for your own server!

## HitBox

# hack on non-player creatures, it's very normal, don't report it.

  # The standard/max Minecraft reach is 3.5 blocks, however it's still calculated in a mysterious way so most people won't even get near that.
  # So, based on all of this info, anything bigger then 3.4 blocks is considered hacks.
  # A lot of people requested to make this more strict; 3.2 is good enough based on what I've heard from people.

  trace_back_length: 3

  # How much should Matrix ignore players with greater network latency?
