#
# The optimized checks for Matrix Anticheat, a powerful anticheat for Minecraft.
# Made for and tested on Matrix 5.3.1+
#
#─── !!  NOTE  !! ───────────────────────────────────────────╮
# YOU *MUST* INSTALL "language.yml" TO USE PLACEHOLDERS!     │
# OTHERWISE, MANY MESSAGES WILL BE UNREADABLE! EVERY MESSAGE │
# CONTAINS PLACEHOLDERS THAT REQUIRE THE LANGUAGE FILE.      │

#
# These checks may not work perfectly with your server.
# Plugins, software, and performance can all affect how well these checks and the anticheat, in general, will work.
# This is not a drag-and-drop solution! Some values may need to be changed to work best with your setup.
#
# Matrix Anticheat, like most, isn't a perfect anticheat. It itself has bugs that we cannot fix.
# These checks aim to mitigate those issues and improve what works well, but there's only so much we can do.
# Tested and configured for survival and minigame servers. Tweak the checks for your own server!
